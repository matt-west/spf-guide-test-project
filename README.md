# PM - Designer Test Project

## Project setup
1. [Install `nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Navigate to project’s directory.
3. `nvm install`
4. `nvm use`
5. `npm install`
6. `npm start` to enable a file watcher and start a local server on [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

## Get started
Once your local server is up and running, you can start writing your code in the files below. Each time you save your changes, your browser will automatically refresh, showing you the latest changes. 
* HTML – `html/index.html`
* SCSS – `html/src/stylesheets/_WORK_HERE.scss`
* Javascript – `html/src/javascripts/WORK_HERE.js`

Running into issues compiling your SCSS or JS? Go ahead and write your code at the bottom of the compiled static versions:
* `html/stylesheets/postmark.css` – Be sure to write vanilla CSS instead of SCSS here.
* `html/javascripts/landing.js`

## Before zipping up your project files
Please do not include the `node_modules` directory when you zip up your project files.

## Commands
* `npm run build` to build all assets.
* `npm start` to enable a file watcher and start a local server on [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).
